# Endless Runner Ghost
You are a ghost and you are in the underworld. You need to go as far as you can to reach the gate to heaven, but it won't be that easy: there will be obstacles that you will need to avoid. If you are caught 3 times you'll be stuck forever in the underworld. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.
